# Multi Key Bindings
[**Github**](https://github.com/kennybc/multi-key-bindings) â€¢ [**Modrinth**](https://modrinth.com/mod/multi-key-bindings)

**Allows players to create multiple keybindings for the same action/function.**

This mod adds extra functionality to the native key binds screen. Simply click the "+" button next to any key binding and a new binding for the selected action should appear.

## Versions and Compatibility

Created for Minecraft version 1.21.4, tested on versions 1.21+
Most recently tested and working on 1.21.6!

<br>

> _Known compatibility issue with the mod "Controlling" which overrides the default MC controls screen. Current workaround is to disable Controlling, set extra key bindings with this mod, then reenable Controlling._

<br>

> _Note that there are niche limitations: e.g. if you set action "Open Inventory" to a mouse button, pressing that mouse button cannot close the inventory as a key would. Similarly, if binding a key to "Pick Block", you will not be able to drag to duplicate a block the way you would be able to with a mouse bind._
