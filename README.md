# Multi Key Bindings
[**Github**](https://github.com/kennybc/multi-key-bindings) â€¢ [**Modrinth**](https://modrinth.com/mod/multi-key-bindings)

**Allows players to create multiple keybindings for the same action/function.**

This mod adds extra functionality to the native key binds screen. Simply click the "+" button next to any key binding and a new binding for the selected action should appear.

## Versions and Compatibility

Created for Minecraft versions 1.20.x and 1.21.x

<br>

> _As of MKB version 1.1.0, this is now compatible with Controlling, so you can search and sort all your key bindings in the same screen._

<br>

> _Note that there are niche limitations: e.g. if you set action "Open Inventory" to a mouse button, pressing that mouse button cannot close the inventory as a key would. Similarly, if binding a key to "Pick Block", you will not be able to drag to duplicate a block the way you would be able to with a mouse bind._
